# Pong-lua
this is a simple pong game created by me using lua - language

It's a single player game, and that too one of the earliest games that were created in history.
One plays against the computer and has to control a mobile bat, to consistently hit a ball like figure.

If the Player ends up missing. he/she looses that chance and vica-versa.

## setting up the game:
  ### just download and run the game 😁.
